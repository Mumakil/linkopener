# linkopener
Safari extension and a small companion app to open links from Safari in default browser

Works for example if you want to use Bumpr.

## Installation

Download and run once in Xcode. Then open Safari and make sure the exension is enabled. You'll then have a context menu item you can use to open any page of link in your default browser.

After you've done that once, you can close the application.
